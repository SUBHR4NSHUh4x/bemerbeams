# Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment Failures

## Understanding Your Specific Errors

You mentioned seeing multiple deployment failures with different project names:

- Vercel – baemer-brands-app - Deployment failed
- Vercel – beamer-brand - Deployment failed
- Vercel – beamer-brands - Deployment failed
- Vercel – beamerbrands - Deployment failed
- Vercel – beamerbrandsemployee - Deployment failed
- Vercel – bemer-brands - Deployment failed
- Vercel – bemer-brands-app - Deployment failed
- Vercel – bemerbrands - Deployment failed
- Vercel – source-code-quiz-spark-project - Deployment failed

This suggests you've tried deploying multiple times with different project names, which may have contributed to hitting rate limits.

## Common Causes for These Failures

### 1. Environment Variable Issues

The most likely cause of your deployment failures is missing or incorrectly referenced environment variables. The error we encountered with the CLI confirms this:

```
Error: Environment Variable "MONGODB_URI" references Secret "mongodb_uri", which does not exist.
```

**Solution:**
- We've updated the `vercel.json` file to remove secret references
- When deploying through the dashboard, manually add all environment variables

### 2. Rate Limiting

The error message from the CLI indicates you've hit Vercel's rate limits for the free tier:

```
Error: Resource is limited - try again in 15 minutes (more than 100, code: "api-deployments-free-per-day").
```

**Solution:**
- Wait 15 minutes before trying again
- Use the Vercel dashboard instead of the CLI for deployment
- Consider upgrading your Vercel plan if you need more deployments

### 3. Multiple Project Attempts

Having multiple failed deployments with different project names suggests you may be creating new projects for each attempt.

**Solution:**
- Stick with a single project name
- Update the existing project rather than creating new ones
- Delete unused projects from your Vercel dashboard

## Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Clean Up Existing Projects**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Delete any failed or unused projects
   - Keep only one project for your Quiz Spark application

2. **Wait for Rate Limit Reset**
   - Wait at least 15 minutes before attempting another deployment

3. **Deploy Through Dashboard**
   - Follow the instructions in `VERCEL_DASHBOARD_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Make sure to add all environment variables manually

4. **Check Build Logs**
   - If deployment fails again, check the build logs for specific errors
   - Look for any missing dependencies or configuration issues

## MongoDB-Specific Issues

If your deployment succeeds but the application shows database connection errors:

1. **Use the Test Endpoint**
   - Visit `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/test-vercel`
   - This endpoint will provide detailed diagnostic information about your MongoDB connection
   - Check the response for any error messages or connection issues

2. **Check Network Access**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Navigate to Network Access
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere (for testing)

3. **Verify Connection String**
   - Make sure the connection string in your environment variables is correct
   - Check for any typos or missing characters
   - Ensure both `MONGO_URL` and `MONGODB_URI` are set correctly

## Clerk Authentication Issues

If your deployment succeeds but authentication doesn't work:

1. **Check Clerk Dashboard**
   - Verify your API keys are correct
   - Make sure your application's domain is added to allowed origins

2. **Update Redirect URLs**
   - Add your Vercel deployment URL to the allowed redirect URLs in Clerk

## Final Checklist Before Deploying

- [ ] Updated vercel.json file with simplified configuration
- [ ] All environment variables ready to be added in the dashboard
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas network access configured
- [ ] Clerk authentication properly set up
- [ ] Waited for any rate limits to reset
- [ ] Cleaned up unused projects in Vercel dashboard

## Final Checklist for Successful Deployment

1. **Initial Deployment Verification**
   - After deployment, first check `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/health`
   - This lightweight endpoint doesn't require database access and will show if your app is running
   - It will display which environment variables are present (without revealing their values)
   - If this endpoint works, your Next.js application is deployed correctly

2. **Database Connection Verification**
   - Once the health check passes, test `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/test-vercel`
   - This will verify your MongoDB connection and provide detailed diagnostics

3. **Environment Variables**
   - All required environment variables are set correctly
   - No typos or missing values

4. **MongoDB Connection**
   - MongoDB Atlas is properly configured
   - Network access is set up correctly
   - Connection string is valid

5. **Clerk Authentication**
   - Clerk keys are set correctly
   - Clerk sign-in and sign-up URLs are configured

6. **Project Configuration**
   - `next.config.mjs` is properly configured
   - Build settings in Vercel are correct

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy your Quiz Spark application to Vercel.
